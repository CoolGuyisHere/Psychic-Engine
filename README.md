# Friday Night Funkin': Psychic Engine :)))
### funkin'... in HTML5!

just a HTML5 port of various mods combined into one site, made cuz I'm bored, and school is BORING!!!!! Mods are used WITHOUT permission, as this is a small project just for my friends and I, however the least I'll do is add credits so i'm not COMPLETELY a little evil man

### Some stuff you might wanna know

This only works on devices with a external keyboard, such as a desktop/laptop computer, or a Chromebook. However you may be able to workshop a way to play on mobile too with some weird third-party app idk
